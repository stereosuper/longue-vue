# Redirections 🔀

## The idea 😏

[Alban 🔥] There's always a moment when your client (often at the project's end) will ask you "How do I handle the redirections? 🤔".

If you didn't thought about it... well, you'll be in lateral safety position 😂

**🚀 BUT NOT WITH THIS MODULE 🚀**

## Easy peasy lemon squeezy 👌

One single config file. The one and only file's output: a query!

In this query you'll need to get all your redirection texts. Then... that's done ✅

The module will get all of those and write them down into your netlify \_redirects file (located at `~/static/_redirects`).
