## Forword

[Alban ðŸ”¥] In the [_doc_ directory](./documentation) you will find all the information you need about the project's specifics.

Those informations are generated from the answers gathered during the project initialization.

The particular elements (modules, components, etc.) added afterwards won't be referenced in this directory.

You can find all of them [here](https://github.com/stereosuper/longue-vue/tree/master/template/docs) and add them to the documentation directory.

## Setup

No need for `npm install`, the modules are already installed ðŸ‘Œ

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ <%= pmRun %> dev

# generate static project
$ <%= pmRun %> generate:modern
```
